# DIY Project Rotating Table

An Arduino based maker project of a rotating table for photography and video takes.

I wanted to build this small table for a long time and finally found the time to do it.
Here in this repository you find the code to run the table.

The 3D models of the project are linked in the Youtube video description.

## Wiring

The wiring is relatively simple as shown in the following diagram.

For the exact PIN number refer to the code itself (or better adjust to your needs there).
